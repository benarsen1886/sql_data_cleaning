# sql_data_cleaning
This is a data cleaning exercise in SQL 
In my previous SQL project i conducted a data exploration of historical olympic games where i showcased my exploration skills in SQL. Moving forward, i would be conducting a short data cleaning of the ‘Fitbit fitness tracker data’.

Data source
The data is a public dataset downloaded from Kaggle and was made available through Mobius. The data was recommended and used in the capstone project of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I have previously conducted an extensive data analysis using same data where i used R and published on kaggle .

Data Processing

I used Google BigQuery for the data cleaning. The main dataset used for the work included

- daily_activity
= Sleep_day
= weight
